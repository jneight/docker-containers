# Based on svendowideit/ambassador
# do
#   docker build -t jneight/ambassador_udp .
# then to run it (on the host that has the real backend on it)
#   docker run -t -i -link redis:redis -name redis_ambassador -p 6379:6379 jneight/ambassador_udp
# on the remote host, you can set up another ambassador
#    docker run -t -i -name redis_ambassador -expose 6379 -e REDIS_PORT_6379_UDP=udp://192.168.1.52:6379 svendowideit/ambassador_udp sh
